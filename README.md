# DenqGuzo
  DenqGuzo is a web application that connects taxi service seekers with drivers. It seeks to facilitate the efficient management of the transportation system by closing the gap of information that exists between the taxi service seekers and providers. 
  Inspiration
    The idea was conceived when my teammate Mikyas, who developed this application with me, made an observation. In our local area, a long queue of people waiting for a taxi at a taxi stand is a common sight. Ironically, at the same time but a different place, a long line of taxis waiting for potential riders could be spotted. This shows there is a lack of information on both sides. And we decided to apply our knowlwdge to address this problem by creating DenqGuzo.
